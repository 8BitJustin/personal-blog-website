# Personal Blog (JODBlog)

Simple website that displays a home page for blog posts, login page for
 admin, and a create/edit/delete page.

## Getting Started

These instructions will advise how to create a profile for login purposes
, create a database for post storage, and how to launch locally
 (instructions on how to deploy to Heroku will not be covered).

### Prerequisites

For this to work, you will want to install Flask, sqlalchemy, and flask_login.

### Installing

First, download the project folder from [here](https://github.com/8BitJustin
/personal-blog).



Within your terminal/cmd/powershell, use pip install for the needed items:

```
pip install Flask
pip install sqlalchemy
pip install flask_login
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
